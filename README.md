# replicant
Replicant mirrors container images between repositories, using the [go-containerregistry](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry) library. This means a Docker daemon is **not needed** for Replicant to mirror images; the library interacts directly with the registry APIs.

## Use-cases
* you're using a lot of open source images and the Docker Hub pull quota is bothering you
* you'd prefer to keep a copy of open source images in your own private repository, just in case the authors ever take theirs offline
* you've been burned by some outages (Docker Hub, Quay.io, etc) and prefer the uptime of your private registry

## How does it work?
Each time Replicant runs, it does a single pass over all images in the config file. It compares the image tags in the source repository to the destination repository and, depending on the selected mode, mirrors applicable images from source to destination using registry APIs (as opposed to `docker` commands). 

The user is expected to take care of scheduling. Some examples include running periodically as a Kubernetes CronJob (as configured in the official Helm chart), via a crontab on a Linux system, or just locally for a one-off migration.

## Configuration options (per source)
* `source`: the 'from' repository
* `destination`: the 'to' repository
* [optional] `mode`: see *mirroring modes* below
* [optional] `compatibility`: pick a single compatibility string (for example, `alpine` or `dind`) to filter on with any of the SemVer modes. Must be an *exact* match, tag `v1.2.3-slim` uses compatibility `slim`. Useful option for images with multiple variants
* [optional] `replace-tag`: if `true`, will check if the image ID for an equal tag is the same for the source and the destination. If not, will replace the tag in the destination repository
* [optional] `pinned-major`: integer value, used to denote on which SemVer major to filter. Used to only duplicate tags in a single major release

### Mirroring modes
Replicant supports 4 types of mirroring in the `mode` field:
1) `highest`: the highest SemVer image tag is mirrored (default mirroring mode)
2) `higher`: all SemVer image tags greater than the highest in the destination repository are mirrored
3) `semver`: all SemVer image tags are mirrored
4) `all`: **all** image tags are mirrored

## Configuration file
Replicant needs a configuration file to function, in the following format:
```yaml
mode: higher # if not specified, defaults to `highest`
images:
  image-name-1:
    source: docker.io/project/image
    destination: gcr.io/private-repo/project/image
    mode: highest|higher|semver|all # if not specified, use top-level mode
    compatibility: alpine # if not specified, will only mirror plain SemVer versions
    replace-tag: true|false # if not specified, defaults to false
    pinned-major: 6 # if not specified, all major versions are acceptable (so long as they're valid in the selected mode)
  image-name-2:
    ...
  image-name-n:
    ...
```

## Global configuration options
Global configuration can either be set via environment variables or as long/short flags to the binary:

|Description|Environment variable|Long flag|Short flag|Type|Default|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Reference to the YAML config file|REPLICANT_CONFIG_FILE|--config-file|-c|string|/config/replicant.yaml|
|Enable debug logging|REPLICANT_DEBUG|--debug|-d|bool|false|
|Stops program execution immediately when an unexpected error is encountered|REPLICANT_EXIT_ON_ERROR|--exit-on-error|-e|bool|false|

## Supported registries
* read from any repository anonymously
* read/write from private Google Container Registry (GCR)
* read/write from private Azure Container Registry (ACR) [untested]
* read/write from private Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) [untested]

Currently, only one set of credentials per registry *type* is supported. This means that, for example, all configured GCR repositories in both `source` and `destination` will use the same credentials. Furthermore, at the current time, GCR/ACR/ECR will always require valid credentials, even when they're publicly readable.

### Registry authentication
#### GCR/Artifact Registry
Replicant uses `NewEnvAuthenticator()` to get credentials automatically. More information on that [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#automatically). When running on GKE, you can combine the above with [Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity).
#### ACR
Supports logging in with [service principal + password](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auth-service-principal#authenticate-with-the-service-principal). Set `AZURE_SP_ID` and `AZURE_SP_PASSWORD` in your environment with the correct values.
#### ECR
Replicant uses [aws-sdk-go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go) to grab a short-lived (12 hour) token to [authenticate with ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/registry_auth.html#registry-auth-token). Set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` in your environment with the correct values.

## Running Replicant
1) Build from source: `make build-binary`
2) Download the binary from a GitHub release
3) Use the official [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/tammert/replicant)
4) Use the official [Helm chart](https://github.com/tammert/helm-charts/tree/main/replicant)
5) Use the official [Helm repo](https://tammer.it/helm-charts/)

## Gotchas
* doesn't work with Docker image V1 schema
* all images are kept in memory, so Replicant will need *at least* as much memory as the (compressed?) size of the largest image you want to mirror
* Docker Hub has rate limit for pulls in place; take this into account when selecting the mode when the source is docker.io
